          There are two mingw32 versions of the pthread-w32 runtime library: the
          standard one, provided by this package, is called libpthreadgc but may
          also be referred to as 'libpthread'.  The non-standard one uses C++
          exception handling, and is called libpthreadgce. (Note that the
          standard library may be used successfully with C++ code; indeed, on
          most *nix platorms the system pthreads implementation follows the
          behavior of mingw32-libpthreadgc, and NOT the behavior of the 'GCE'
          version).  We recommend that most users rely on mingw32-libpthreadgc
          ('GC') and not mingw32-libpthreadgce ('GCE').

          The mingw32-libpthreadgc and mingw32-libpthreadgce packages provide

          one).  The associated mingw32-pthreads-w32 package provides the
          documentation for the pthreads-w32 library, as well as the related
          development files.  The mingw32-libquserex package provides optional
          support for enhanced standards conformance of the GCE runtime.

          NOTE: The 2.9.1 and later releases do not deliver this library.
          This decision was based on the number of downloads for the library
          and the fact that it is experimental.

          implementation of pthreads for Windows.  Pthreads is an API for
          writing multithreaded applications following the POSIX standard.
          libquserex is an optional library to enable enhanced standards
          conformance of the non-standard mingw32-libpthreadgce ('GCE') runtime.
          It provides access to a a kernel mode driver, AlertDrv.sys, which if
          installed allows ordinary users to exploit the Win32 QueueUserAPCEx
          function call.
        </paragraph>
        <paragraph>
          There are two mingw32 versions of the pthread-w32 runtime library: the
          non-standard one provided by mingw32-libpthreadgce ('GCE') uses C++
          exceptions, and for full POSIX conformance needs a kernel mode driver
          installed.  The standard runtime, mingw32-libpthreadgc ('GC') does not
          require that driver for full standards conformance, and may be used
          with C++ code; we recommend that most users rely on
          mingw32-libpthreadgc ('GC') and not mingw32-libpthreadgce ('GCE').
        </paragraph>
        <paragraph>
          However, for those that wish to experiment with the non-standard
          ('GCE') runtime, this optional helper library may also be of use --
          provided the kernel mode driver, available from mingw.org, is also
          installed.  Note that the kernel mode driver can not currently be
          installed on W7 (64bit) or Windows Server 2008R2 (64bit) because those
          operating systems require kernel mode drivers to be digitally signed,
          so this mingw32-libquserex package is rather useless on those
          platforms.
        </paragraph>
        <paragraph>
          The kernel mode driver is available at mingw.org or mirror site,
          packaged as an InnoSetup installer executable called
          QueueUserAPCEx-installer.exe.

        <paragraph>
          The mingw32-libpthread-old package provides the MinGW pthreads-w32
          runtime dll associated with MinGW GCC 4.5.2 and older. Due to an
          unfortunate naming choice, upgrading to newer GCC will also install
          the newer, renamed pthreads-w32 DLLs, removing the old DLL. While the
          may not affect the new GCC, threaded applications compiled using the
          older compiler will break, as they will miss this runtime library.
          Therefore, the old runtime library is provided here using a new
          package name: mingw32-libpthread-old, so that it can be (re)installed
          parallel to the new pthreads-w32 runtime libraries.

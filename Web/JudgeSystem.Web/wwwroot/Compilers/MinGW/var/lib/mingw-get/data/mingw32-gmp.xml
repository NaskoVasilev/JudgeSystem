        <paragraph>
          GNU MP is a library for arbitrary precision arithmetic, operating on
          signed integers, rational numbers, and floating point numbers.  It has
          a rich set of functions, and the functions have a regular interface.
        </paragraph>
        <paragraph>
          The MinGW/MSYS project provides two gmp packages: the native win32
          mingw32-gmp and an MSYS version, msys-gmp.  mingw32-gmp is provided
          as a necessary component of modern MinGW gcc compilers, while the
          msys-gmp version requires the MSYS dll, and is provided as a
          prerequisite of certain other MSYS tools, such as guile.
        </paragraph>
        <paragraph>
          The mingw32-gmp package provides the documentation for the gmp
          library, as well as the related development files.  The associated
          mingw32-libgmp package provides the C runtime library, while the
          associated mingw32-libgmpxx package provides the C++ runtime library.

        <paragraph>The zlib compression library provides in-memory compression

          package provides documentation.

      <description lang="en" title="Simple ZIP support from zlib">
        <paragraph>NOTE: This program was not delivered with the zlib-1.2.8
          release. This decision was made due to the number of downloads for
          the package as well as a belief that the zip and unzip packages are
          already minimal enough.  It is therefore considered obsolete and
          should be removed from your systems.
        </paragraph>
        <paragraph>The minizip package provides two simple ZIP archive
          manipulation tools, based on the minizip library from zlib.  More
          sophisticated needs are met by the unzip and zip packages.
        </paragraph>
        <paragraph>The libminizip library provides zlib-based support for
          manipulating ZIP archives. It is suitable for clients that need only
          create, inspect, and unpack such archives; more demanding needs may be
          met by the libarchive package.

      <description lang="en" title="GNU make utility to maintain groups of programs" >
        <paragraph>The `make' utility automatically determines which pieces
          of a large program need to be recompiled, and issues commands to
          recompile them. GNU `make' was implemented by Richard Stallman
          and Roland McGrath.  Development since Version 3.76 has been
          handled by Paul D. Smith.
        </paragraph>
        <paragraph>This is a case-preserving version of GNU make. While the
          win32 file systems encountered when using MSYS software are
          invariably case-INsensitive, some users prefer a GNU `make' that
          itself is case-sensitive -- this version of make is a compromise
          which exploits the case-preserving aspect of win32 file systems.
          It considers *all* targets as fundamentally case-insensitive, but
          first attempts to resolve them as case-sensitive, falling back to
          the case-insensitive behaviour only if the case-sensitive match
          remains unresolved.
        </paragraph>
        <paragraph>The MinGW/MSYS project provides two versions of make:
          this msys-make version acts generally more as make is intended
          to operate, and gives fewer headaches during execution. However,
          msys-make requires the MSYS dll.  The other version, mingw32-make,
          does not require the MSYS dll, but because of the lack of POSIX
          support in "pure" Win32 has a number of known shortcomings in
          comparison.

    <description lang="en" title="Windows System Libraries Meta-Package">
      <paragraph>
        This meta-package provides a delivery mechanism to support
        pre-release testing of the upcoming windows system library
        packages.  You are advised to install this package, ONLY if
        you wish to participate in the pre-release testing of the
        windows system libraries release candidate packages.
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph>
        A two stage installation procedure is required; first, to
        initialise the pre-release testing infrastructure:
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph>
        $ mingw-get install mingw32-wsl_rc
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph>
        Second, to install the release candidate software packages,
        and switch to the testing environment:
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph>
        $ mingw-get install mingw32-wsl_rc-test-on
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph>
        Having thus activated the testing environment, you are advised
        to immediately, (and without prejudice to its operation):
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph>
        $ mingw-get remove mingw32-wsl_rc-test-on
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph>
        While in the testing environment, and after removing the
        mingw32-wsl_rc-test-on package, you may revert all associated
        software packages to their production releases, thus switching
        back to a production environment, by:
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph>
        $ mingw-get install mingw32-wsl_rc-test-off
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph>
        As before, after installing this, you are advised to immediately,
        (and again without prejudice to the working environment):
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph>
        $ mingw-get remove mingw32-wsl_rc-test-off
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph>
        Finally, if having installed mingw32-wsl_rc, you subsequently 
        decide to remove it, please ensure that you have removed either
        or both of mingw32-wsl_rc-test-on and mingw32-wsl_rc-test-off,
        BEFORE you do so.
      </paragraph>

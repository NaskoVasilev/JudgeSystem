/* Package version identification: formerly specified as a simple
 * dotted numeric pair representing major.minor, this doesn't adapt
 * well to the inclusion of the patch-level, since the dotted triplet
 * representation of major.minor.patch is not a valid representation
 * of a numeric entity.  Thus, from version 3.18 onwards we adopt a
 * representation which encodes the version as a long integer value,
 * expressing:
 *
 *   __W32API_VERSION = 1,000,000 * major + 1,000 * minor + patch
 *
 * DO NOT EDIT these package version assignments manually; they are
 * derived from the package version specification within configure.ac,
 * whence they are propagated automatically, at package build time.

/* Only Microsoft could attempt to justify this insanity: when building
 * a UTF-16LE application -- apparently their understanding of Unicode is
 * limited to this -- the C/C++ runtime requires that the user must define
 * the _UNICODE macro, while to use the Windows API's UTF-16LE capabilities,
 * it is the UNICODE macro, (without the leading underscore), which must be
 * defined.  The (bogus) explanation appears to be that it is the C standard
 * which dictates the requirement for the leading underscore, to avoid any
 * possible conflict with a user defined symbol; (bogus because the macro
 * must be user defined anyway -- it is not a private symbol -- and in
 * any case, the Windows API already reserves the UNICODE symbol as
 * a user defined macro, with equivalent intent.
 *
 * The real explanation, of course, is that this is just another example
 * of Microsoft irrationality; in any event, there seems to be no sane
 * scenario in which defining one without the other would be required,
 * or indeed would not raise potential for internal inconsistency, so we
 * ensure that either both are, or neither is defined.

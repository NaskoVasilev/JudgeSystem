 *
 * __DECLSPEC_SUPPORTED            Defined if dllimport attribute is supported.
 * __MINGW_IMPORT                  The attribute definition to specify imported

 *
 * Macros to enable MinGW features which deviate from standard MSVC
 * compatible behaviour; these may be specified directly in user code,
 * activated implicitly, (e.g. by specifying _POSIX_C_SOURCE or such),
 * or by inclusion in __MINGW_FEATURES__:
 *

 * __int64                         define to be long long.  Using a typedef
 *                                 doesn't work for "unsigned __int64"
 *
 *
 * Manifest definitions for flags to control globbing of the command line
 * during application start up, (before main() is called).  The first pair,
 * when assigned as bit flags within _CRT_glob, select the globbing algorithm
 * to be used; (the MINGW algorithm overrides MSCVRT, if both are specified).
 * Prior to mingwrt-3.21, only the MSVCRT option was supported; this choice
 * may produce different results, depending on which particular version of
 * MSVCRT.DLL is in use; (in recent versions, it seems to have become
 * definitively broken, when globbing within double quotes).

 * by setting _CRT_glob to the boolean sum (i.e. logical OR combination)
 * of __CRT_GLOB_USE_MINGW__ and the desired options.
 *
 *    __CRT_GLOB_USE_SINGLE_QUOTE__	allows use of single (apostrophe)
 *    					quoting characters, analogously to

 *    					double quotes, for collection of
 *    					arguments separated by white space
 *    					into a single logical argument.
 *

 *    					character groups as POSIX compatible
 *    					globbing patterns, matching any one
 *    					character which is either included
 *    					in, or excluded from the group.
 *
 * The following options, which may also be specified within _CRT_glob,
 * are specified in terms of their glob() flags, as defined in <glob.h>
 *
 *    GLOB_CASEMATCH			enable case sensitive matching for
 *    					globbing patterns; this is default
 *    					behaviour for POSIX, but because of
 *    					the case insensitive nature of the
 *    					MS-Windows file system, it is more
 *    					appropriate to use case insensitive
 *    					globbing as the MinGW default.
 *

# JudgeSystem
"C# MVC Frameworks - ASP.NET Core - June 2019" final Project

##Description
This is a judge system, similar to SoftUni judge but a bit more simple.
Aims of this platform are to be used in school. It can make work of our teachers more easier and also students will be
able to solve more problems and check their solutions faster. I beleive that using this application more students become
passionate about programming and may become successfull developers one day.
